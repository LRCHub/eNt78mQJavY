[00:00.87] Remember when I told you
[00:02.52] No matter where I go
[00:04.73] I'll never leave your side
[00:06.63] You will never be alone
[00:09.08] Even when we go through changes
[00:12.15] Even when we're old
[00:14.09] Remember that I told you
[00:16.24] I'll find my way back home
[00:29.24] 
[00:27.39] I could never let you go
[00:30.77] Couldn't run away if I tried
[00:33.08] 'Cause even when I'm all alone
[00:35.18] You still got a hold on my mind
[00:37.50] And I'll always let you know
[00:39.93] That I'm always gonna hold on
[00:54.43] 
[00:44.37] And I told you right from the start
[00:47.56] You just say the word and I'll go
[00:49.66] No, it doesn't matter how far
[00:52.01] 'Cause your love is all that I know
[00:54.34] Baby, you just stay where you are
[00:56.92] And you know I won't be too long
[00:59.67] Hold on
[01:01.51] Hold on
[01:05.01] 
[01:03.65] Remember when I told you
[01:05.08] No matter where I go
[01:08.13] I'll never leave your side
[01:10.49] You will never be alone
[01:12.35] Even when we go through changes
[01:15.16] Even when we're old
[01:17.31] Remember that I told you
[01:19.68] I'll find my way back home
[01:32.68] 
[01:39.47] 조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어
[01:44.19] 부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라
[01:48.61] 길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아
[01:53.30] 그만 그만
[01:55.80] 
[01:58.22] 멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
[02:02.59] 아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
[02:06.16] 길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
[02:11.52] 너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home
[02:25.02] 
[02:15.83] 세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
[02:21.15] 오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
[02:25.20] No, I won't ever lose
[02:29.71] As long as you're there
[02:41.21] 
[02:43.44] 눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
[02:47.80] 이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가
[03:01.34] Even when we go through changes
[03:04.02] Even when we're old
[03:06.47] Remember that I told you
[03:08.31] I'll find my way back home
